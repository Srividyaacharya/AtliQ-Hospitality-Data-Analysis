# 🏨 Atliq Grands Hospitality Data Analysis - SQL

### Problem Statement 

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India 🇮🇳. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors  соперники and ineffective decision-making in management , Atliq Grands are losing its market share  and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence”  in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights .

Their revenue management team  had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Database Schema

The database `AtliQGrands` includes the following tables:

- `dim_hotels`
- `dim_rooms`
- `dim_date`
- `fact_bookings`
- `fact_aggregated_bookings`

## Key Insights

- 🏨 **Top Hotels Drive Major Revenue**: A small percentage of hotels (about 30%) contribute nearly 70% of the total revenue, indicating a strong Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) in hotel revenue generation.
  
- 💰 **Significant Revenue Loss from Cancellations**: Cancellations cause a measurable drop in ideal revenue, highlighting the need for better cancellation policies or incentives to reduce no-shows.

- 📈 **Strong Weekday vs Weekend Trends**: Occupancy rates are noticeably higher on weekends compared to weekdays, suggesting opportunities for weekday promotions to balance occupancy.

- 🛌 **Room Categories Matter**: Premium and deluxe room categories generate the highest revenue and have higher occupancy rates compared to standard rooms.

- 🌆 **City-Specific Trends**: Certain cities consistently outperform others in both occupancy and revenue, suggesting that marketing efforts should be focused based on city performance.

- 📊 **Platform Performance Varies**: Bookings from certain platforms (like OTA partners vs direct website) show significant differences in volume and cancellation rates, impacting net revenue.

- 🔄 **Fluctuating Weekly Booking Trends**: Booking and revenue trends vary significantly week-over-week, reflecting seasonality, promotions, and external factors.

- 💹 **Stable ADR and REVPAR**: Despite fluctuations in booking volume, the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue Per Available Room (REVPAR) remain relatively stable, showing strong revenue management practices.


- 🚀 **Opportunities for Optimization**:
  - Increase direct bookings to reduce platform commissions.
  - Target promotions during low-occupancy weekdays.
  - Implement stricter cancellation policies or flexible booking options to reduce revenue loss.
